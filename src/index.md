Documentation
=============
These are some docs I'm throwing together. I've split them into a few main areas:

- [Getting Started](getting-started/index.html). What SproutCore is, and how to set it up.
- [Introductory Overviews](intro-overviews/index.html). How SproutCore works, and your apps
  _should_ work.
- [Class Overviews](class-overviews/index.html). High-level overviews on how specific
  classes may be used.
- [Class Internal Overviews](class-internals/index.html). High-level overviews on how specific
  classes work internally (for people who want to edit said classes).
- [Contributor's Guide](contributors-guide/index.html). Instructions on how to contribute to SproutCore.
- [Class Reference](reference/index.html). Low-level, function-by-function class reference documentation.

Testing.
