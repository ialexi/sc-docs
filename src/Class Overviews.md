Class Overviews
===============

The docs on docs.sproutcore.com, though sometimes incomplete, are generally good for low-level
reference. Low-level reference is great, but only tells you the what. It would be nice to have
whys as well, so I'm making these overviews as and when it pleases me.

Hopefully, I won't stop with the one I've got. :) If anyone wants to pitch in, I will edit
contributions for grammar and clarity if needed. :D
